                          Team Rookies 
It has been almost 220 days since I have started working on the hoodie desktop application. When we started working we had low self confidence. Even though we have taken classes on different programming languages but when it comes to working with it we always thought that we do not have all the knowledge it takes to get the job done.
But now we have understood that every working experience is an opportunity to teach ourselves new things everyday.

The very first lesson we have learned so far was using Git. we have done several school projects that we  have managed to save and clone project repositories on git . But after we have started working on the hoodie desktop application we have understood very well how the git actually works and how it is used when lots of contributors are working on the same project.

Other that using git we have also learned a lot on UI building using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
There has been times where we would solve certain problems using very long process but when working with advanced coaches and mentors we have learned different ways of solving  them. And most of the times the new approaches are even more easy and clear to understand. 

The best part of having mentors and coaches around while working on this project was the confidence we have to try out all the possible ways that would come to our head or try all the things we would come across while surfing on the internet, thinking that if there would be something we would not understand there is definetly one person who would have a very deep knowledge about it and help us grasp the concept very well.
